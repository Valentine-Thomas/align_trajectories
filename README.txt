This is a simplified version of the plot_all_POI where each different section are separated and called through a master code for easier updating

Master_code: upload necessary modules, charge data, align trajectories in time and space

averaging_data: code to get average x position, y position and fluorescence. 

get_distances: get directed and median directed distances as well as MAD
